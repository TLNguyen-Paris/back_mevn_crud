# Backend CRUD MEVN Stack

This is the backend of my CRUD project, check out the front on this [link](https://github.com/TLNguyen-Paris/front_mevn_crud). For any question you can add me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thanh-nguyen-paris/)

This project was created in order to learn how to split frontend and backend and communicate between them using MEVN stack (Mongo, Express, Vue3, Node).

Depedencies used : nodemon, mongoose, express, dotenv, cors, body-parser


## How to install ? 

You can clone it or fork it but the code will not work fully because of the environment variable. You will need to add an Mongo database URL.

This project is deployed on heroku (it can takes few second to render) on this [link](https://vue-crud-thanh.herokuapp.com/) or [https://vue-crud-thanh.herokuapp.com/](https://vue-crud-thanh.herokuapp.com/) DATABASE IS DISABLE
